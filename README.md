The essence of "The essence of functional programming" in Scala
---------------------------------------------------------------

Ralf LÃ¤mmel has resurrected the Haskell code ["The essence of functional programming"](http://www.eliza.ch/doc/wadler92essence_of_FP.pdf)
in his post "[The essence of "The essence of functional programming"](http://professor-fish.blogspot.com/2010/09/essence-of-essence-of-functional.html)"

Code here is just an attempt to recreate in scala (using same or similar naming conventions) as a way for my own better understanding of Haskell.
